/**
 * "You own this" marker for a game poster.
 *
 * Appears on every card across the site, so the answer to "do I already have
 * this?" never requires opening the page. That question is asked constantly
 * while browsing a store-like catalogue, and answering it inline is the single
 * cheapest way to stop someone buying a game twice.
 *
 * Renders nothing at all when the game isn't owned, or when nobody is signed
 * in — an empty badge slot on every card would be pure noise.
